<h1>Lone Dog</h1> 
<h2>Irene Rutherford McLeod (1891 - 1968)</h2>

<p>
    I’m a lean dog, a keen dog, a wild dog, and lone;<br>
    I’m a rough dog, a tough dog, hunting on my own;<br>
    I’m a bad dog, a mad dog, teasing silly sheep;<br>
    I love to sit and bay the moon, to keep fat souls from sleep.
</p>
<p>
    I’ll never be a lap dog, licking dirty feet,<br>
    A sleek dog, a meek dog, cringing for my meat,<br>
    Not for me the fireside, the well-filled plate,<br>
    But shut door, and sharp stone, and cuff and kick, and hate.
</p>
<p>
    Not for me the other dogs, running by my side,<br>
    Some have run a short while, but none of them would bide.<br>
    O mine is still the lone trail, the hard trail, the best,<br>
    Wide wind, and wild stars, and hunger of the quest!
</p>
