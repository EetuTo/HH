            <p>Tabletop hobbies and other nerd stuff have been a part of my life for a really long time. I think it might have started when my
                father showed me the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Putting on an audiobook and just painting toy soldiers is really relaxing and is my one of my favourite things to do.
                </p>
                <p>My current hobby project is the XIVth legion called the Death Guard. This army project is for a game called Horus Heresy 
                    produced by Games Workshop. In the setting humanitys massive space empire is divided by civil war. There are also
                    over 50 audiobooks about the setting produced by the same company so I'm not going to run out of stuff to listen any time soon.</p>
